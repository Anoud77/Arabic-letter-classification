# Arabic Letter Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying images of Arabic letters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify and categorize images of individual Arabic letters. This can be a useful component in larger applications such as:

* Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Arabic text
* Educational tools for learning the Arabic alphabet
* Linguistic research and analysis

## Dataset

The project uses the Arabic Characters MNIST dataset, which contains images of 28 isolated Arabic letters.

## Model Architecture

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture consists of the following layers:

* Convolutional layers for feature extraction
* Max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
* Batch normalization for improved training stability
* Dropout layers for regularization
* Flatten layer to prepare for fully connected layers
* Dense layers for classification

## Dependencies

* Python 3
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* OpenCV (cv2)
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Kaggle API (optional, for downloading the dataset)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required dependencies.
3.  Download the Arabic Characters MNIST dataset from Kaggle.
4.  Place the dataset in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

1.  Load the dataset.
2.  Preprocess the images.
3.  Define the CNN model architecture.
4.  Train the model.
5.  Evaluate the model performance.
6.  Visualize the results.

## Results

The model achieves a test accuracy of 93.10% on the Arabic Characters MNIST dataset.

## Visualizations

* Sample images from the dataset
* Training and validation accuracy plot
* Confusion Matrix

## Future Improvements

* Explore different CNN architectures.
* Implement data augmentation techniques.
* Train the model for more epochs.
* Evaluate the model on a larger dataset.
* Deploy the model for real-world applications.
